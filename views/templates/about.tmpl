        <h2>What Is OETF Now??</h2>
        <p>Well, the idea for OETF came from #oc, the IRC Channel of OpenComputer. We saw a few people talk about standards they developed for their programs.
        But there was a important thing missing: <br /> A central place to post these standards and diskuss them.</p>
        <p>I mean, we can all agree that standards are a good thing. Yeah, you have to read them and sometimes following them can be a hassle, but the efford is so worth it!</p>
        <p>Your OS will be compatible with other OS'es or your program can run on every OS without a single line rewritten!</p>
        <p>So thats why we created this place. For free sharing of ideas for standards, developing standards and of course diskussing those standards.</p>

        <h2>Interested? Cool!</h2>
        This site is not fully finished (as in Not at all), but we'll make sure to announce on #oc as soon as it is. Make sure to work on your standard until then!

        <h2>How does <code>&lt;stuff&gt;</code> work??</h2>
        <p>Well, if you wanna know how some stuff on this page works, you have two choices.
        You can either go have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/OpenEngeneeringTaskForce/OETFDev">Sourcecode</a>, or you can log into IRC and punch Dean when he's online.
        If he's still able to talk afterwards he will very likely tell you.

        <h2>TL; DR</h2>
        <p>What are you doing on a page full of standards (aka very long text files);<br />And don't want to read??</p>
